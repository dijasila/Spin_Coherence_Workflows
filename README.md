# Overview
Spin coherence is a critical property in quantum systems, particularly in quantum information science and condensed matter physics. This repository offers workflows to study spin coherence, simulate dynamics, and analyze effects like decoherence and entanglement across various configurations.

The workflows are modular, extensible, and optimized for efficiency, enabling researchers to customize them for a broad range of spin coherence studies.

# Features

# Simulation of Spin Dynamics: 
Tools to simulate time evolution and coherence in spin systems.
# Coherence Metrics: Compute and analyze coherence metrics (e.g., T1, T2 times).
# Visualization Tools: 
Generate visual representations of spin dynamics and coherence over time.
# Customizable Workflows: 
Easily extend and adapt workflows for specific research requirements.

# Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required packages (specified in requirements.txt):
numpy
scipy
matplotlib
Additional dependencies may apply.
Steps

# Clone the repository:

git clone git@github.com:dijasila/Spin_Coherence_Workflows.git
cd Spin_Coherence_Workflows
Set up the virtual environment and install dependencies:


python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
Set Up Configurations: Adjust configuration files in the configs/ directory to define parameters for spin simulations.

Run a Simulation: Use the main script to initiate a simulation. For example:

bash

python main.py --config configs/example_config.json
Analyze Results: Utilize analysis tools to review outputs, such as coherence times and decay rates.

Generate Visualizations: Create visual summaries and plots of results using the visualization scripts.

For additional commands, see examples in the scripts/ directory.
