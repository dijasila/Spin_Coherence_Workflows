Overview
Spin coherence is a fundamental property of quantum systems, especially in quantum information science and condensed matter physics. This repository provides a set of workflows to help researchers study the coherence properties of spin systems, simulate dynamics, and explore effects such as decoherence and entanglement in various configurations.

The workflows are intended to be modular, extensible, and efficient, enabling customization for different types of spin coherence simulations.

Features
Simulation of Spin Dynamics: Tools for simulating time evolution and coherence in spin systems.
Coherence Metrics: Calculate and analyze coherence metrics such as T1, T2 times, and others.
Visualization Tools: Generate visualizations of spin dynamics and coherence properties over time.
Customizable Workflows: Easily extend or modify workflows for specific research needs.
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required packages (listed in requirements.txt):
numpy
scipy
matplotlib
Additional dependencies as needed.
Steps
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone git@github.com:dijasila/Spin_Coherence_Workflows.git
cd Spin_Coherence_Workflows
Install dependencies: It’s recommended to use a virtual environment.

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Set Up Your Configuration: Customize the configuration files located in the configs/ directory to specify parameters for your spin simulations.
Run a Simulation: Execute the main script to start a simulation. For example:

python main.py --config configs/example_config.json
Analyze Results: Use the analysis tools to examine the output data, such as coherence times, decay rates, and other metrics.
Generate Visualizations: Use visualization scripts to create plots and visual summaries of the results.
Example commands for running a simulation or visualization can be found in the scripts/ directory.
